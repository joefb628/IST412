This application is meant to provide a helpful tool for patients and medical staff. Currently, it has two use cases. The first allows the user to view treatments.
These treatments are placed in a table and can be searched for by the user. The user cna also add to new treatmetns to the table. The second use case involves viewing patient
data. 

The application starts with a log in page. The test username is "username" and the test password is "password". After authentication, the user is taken to the navigation page.
This allows them to access the other features of the app including our two use cases.
